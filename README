Code Conventions:
All submitted code should follow the Google Java Guide Lines, except the following Changes:
- (Section 2.3.1)	Tabs are used for indentation
- 					Tabs should be represented with 4 whitespace characters
- (Section 4.2) 	Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by one Tab
- (Section 4.4) 	The column limit doesn't have to be followed //This is done because some of the frameworks have very long names, so you would often have to rip apart your code without adding readability
