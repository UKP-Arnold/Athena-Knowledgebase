Code Conventions:

- (Section 4.2) 	Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by one Tab
- (Section 4.4) 	The column limit doesn't have to be followed //This is done because some of the frameworks have very long names, so you would often have to rip apart your code without adding readability
